# Architectural Decision Records (Styling)

## Context and Problem Statement
Styling in React feels... unnatural! I need an easy to understand, inspect, and debug styling method. It would be great to learn something new and flex my skills, but I'd also like to have something that isn't completely opposite to my current understanding of HTML -> CSS -> JS so that it doesn't negatively affect my productivity.

## Considered Options
- Styled Components
- Tailwind UI
- Material UI
- CSS Modules

### Decision Outcome
